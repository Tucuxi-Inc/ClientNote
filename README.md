## Session Note Generation Process

Euni™ uses a sophisticated two-pass analysis system to generate high-quality clinical notes. Here's how it works:

### Input Methods

1. **Traditional Entry**
   - Type or dictate your session notes freely
   - Include any relevant observations, interventions, and client responses
   - Natural language processing identifies therapeutic techniques and client engagement

2. **EasyNote Form**
   - Structured form for quick, guided input
   - Select specific therapeutic approaches and interventions
   - Document client responses and engagement
   - Add additional notes through typing or dictation
   - Includes fields for:
     - Session information (date, time, location)
     - Therapeutic approaches used
     - Specific interventions applied
     - Client response and engagement
     - Treatment goals and progress
     - Risk assessments when applicable

### Smart Analysis System

The app performs two intelligent analyses on your input:

1. **Therapeutic Modalities Analysis**
   - Identifies therapeutic techniques and interventions used
   - Recognizes evidence-based practices (CBT, DBT, ACT, etc.)
   - Maps specific interventions to therapeutic approaches
   - Ensures accurate clinical terminology

2. **Client Engagement Analysis**
   - Evaluates client responsiveness and participation
   - Assesses engagement across multiple dimensions:
     - General receptiveness
     - Active listening
     - Response to interventions
     - Nonverbal communication
     - Commitment to treatment
   - Provides professional descriptions of client engagement

### Note Generation

The app combines these analyses with your input to generate a comprehensive clinical note that:

- Uses proper clinical terminology and phrasing
- Follows your chosen note format

# Euni‚Ñ¢ - Client Notes

Euni‚Ñ¢ - Client Notes is a powerful macOS application designed for mental health professionals to streamline their clinical documentation process. Using advanced AI technology, the app helps clinicians generate comprehensive, insurance-ready psychotherapy notes while maintaining professional standards and clinical accuracy.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Note Generation**: Leverages advanced language models to create detailed clinical notes
- **Multiple Input Methods**: Choose between traditional free-form entry or structured EasyNote forms
- **Professional Clinical Language**: Ensures proper terminology and formatting for insurance requirements
- **Secure Local Processing**: All processing happens locally on your machine using Ollama
- **Customizable Note Formats**: Supports various note formats (SOAP, BIRP, DAP, etc.)
- **Voice Input Support**: Dictate your notes using built-in speech recognition
- **ICD-10 Code Integration**: Quick access to diagnostic codes
- **Client Management**: Organize notes by client and session

## Session Note Generation Process

Euni‚Ñ¢ uses a sophisticated two-pass analysis system to generate high-quality clinical notes. Here's how it works:

### Input Methods

1. **Traditional Entry**
   - Type or dictate your session notes freely
   - Include any relevant observations, interventions, and client responses
   - Natural language processing identifies therapeutic techniques and client engagement

2. **EasyNote Form**
   - Structured form for quick, guided input
   - Select specific therapeutic approaches and interventions
   - Document client responses and engagement
   - Add additional notes through typing or dictation
   - Includes fields for:
     - Session information (date, time, location)
     - Therapeutic approaches used
     - Specific interventions applied
     - Client response and engagement
     - Treatment goals and progress
     - Risk assessments when applicable

### Smart Analysis System

The app performs two intelligent analyses on your input:

1. **Therapeutic Modalities Analysis**
   - Identifies therapeutic techniques and interventions used
   - Recognizes evidence-based practices (CBT, DBT, ACT, etc.)
   - Maps specific interventions to therapeutic approaches
   - Ensures accurate clinical terminology

2. **Client Engagement Analysis**
   - Evaluates client responsiveness and participation
   - Assesses engagement across multiple dimensions:
     - General receptiveness
     - Active listening
     - Response to interventions
     - Nonverbal communication
     - Commitment to treatment
   - Provides professional descriptions of client engagement

### Note Generation

The app combines these analyses with your input to generate a comprehensive clinical note that:

- Uses proper clinical terminology and phrasing
- Follows your chosen note format
- Integrates therapeutic techniques appropriately
- Describes client engagement professionally
- Maintains insurance-ready documentation standards
- Includes relevant diagnostic codes
- Documents risk assessments when needed

### Professional Standards

All generated notes adhere to:
- Insurance documentation requirements
- Clinical best practices
- Professional documentation standards
- Proper clinical terminology
- Appropriate level of detail

## Privacy and Security

- All note generation happens locally on your machine
- No clinical data is sent to external servers
- Client data is stored securely on your device
- Compliant with clinical documentation standards

## Recent Development Work

### Major Bug Fixes and System Improvements

The following section documents significant debugging and improvement work completed to resolve critical issues with the chat system, AI generation workflows, and user experience.

#### 1. Chat Data Persistence System Overhaul

**Problem**: Chat content was not being saved or loaded correctly, with aggressive filtering removing legitimate user content during save operations.

**Solution**: Complete rewrite of `saveActivityContent()` in `ChatViewModel.swift`:
- Removed overly aggressive duplicate detection that was filtering out valid user messages
- Implemented highly specific analysis prompt detection using exact string matching
- Added comprehensive debug logging throughout the save/load pipeline
- Streamlined `loadActivityChat()` to trust already-filtered save data format

#### 2. Two-Pass Generation Cleanup

**Problem**: The two-pass AI generation system was creating messy chat displays with multiple intermediate messages, analysis artifacts, and confusing user interfaces.

**Solution**: Streamlined generation workflow in `handleGenerateAction()`:
- Eliminated intermediate message creation during two-pass analysis
- Implemented clean user prompt + final response display pattern
- Improved loading state management with proper UI feedback
- Separated analysis processing from user-visible chat content

#### 3. Analysis System Isolation

**Problem**: The `generateAnalysis()` function was using `MessageViewModel` which created temporary messages that polluted the main chat interface.

**Solution**: Complete rewrite using direct `OllamaKit` API calls:
- Eliminated ALL temporary message creation during analysis
- Implemented pure API-based analysis without UI side effects
- Maintained analysis functionality while keeping chat interface clean
- Added proper error handling for analysis failures

#### 4. Activity Switching and State Management

**Problem**: Switching between different activity types (Session Notes, Treatment Plans, Brainstorm) wasn't properly clearing chat state, leading to content contamination between activities.

**Solution**: Enhanced activity management in `onActivitySelected()`:
- Added robust client validation and recursive correction for invalid selections
- Improved state synchronization between activity types
- Fixed onChange handlers in `ChatView.swift` to properly handle activity switching
- Restored critical `updateSystemPrompt()` calls for proper activity isolation

#### 5. Format Parameter Debugging

**Problem**: Note format overrides (like EasyNote PIRP format) were being ignored, defaulting to SOAP format instead.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive format debugging pipeline:
- Implemented detailed logging in `generateStructuredNote()` tracking format parameter flow
- Added parameter tracing from `noteFormat` ‚Üí `selectedNoteFormat` ‚Üí `formatToUse`
- Enhanced debug output to identify where format parameters are lost or overridden

#### 6. System Architecture Improvements

**Code Quality Enhancements**:
- Added extensive debug logging throughout critical code paths
- Implemented proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Created comprehensive testing checklist for all major workflows
- Documented complex interaction patterns between ViewModels

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Eliminated unnecessary UI updates during background processing
- Streamlined chat loading and saving operations
- Reduced memory overhead by removing temporary message objects

#### 7. Developer Documentation

**Created comprehensive codebase documentation**:
- `CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md` with detailed architecture overview
- Complete mapping of data flow between major components
- Testing procedures for all three activity workflows
- Debug feature documentation for troubleshooting

### Known Issues and Future Work

**Current Focus Areas**:
- Activity isolation refinement (ensuring complete separation between activity types)
- Format parameter handling in complex generation workflows
- Streaming feedback implementation for two-pass generation progress
- Enhanced error recovery and user feedback mechanisms

**Testing Status**:
- Core two-pass functionality: ‚úÖ Working
- Session note generation: ‚úÖ Working  
- Activity switching: üîÑ Improved, refinement ongoing
- Format override handling: üîç Under investigation
- Chat history isolation: üîÑ Improved, testing ongoing

### Development Environment
